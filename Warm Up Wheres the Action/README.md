# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Project Warm Up

## Where's the Action

### Intro

As a developer creating apps, you'll need to find ways to inform your users which button or link is currently 'active'.  This will need to be accomplished in the List Pagination and Filter Project.  Here’s some lightweight practice working with a short list of buttons.  You’ll use JavaScript to remove the 'active' class name from all buttons and add it to the most recently clicked button.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome dev tools console.  If you don't know how to do that, reach out in Slack.  Then follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, the most recently clicked button should have different styles to indicate that it is 'active'.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
