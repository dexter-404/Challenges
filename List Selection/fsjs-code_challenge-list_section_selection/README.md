## List Section Selection - great practice for project 2: List Pagination and Filtering

### Intro

As a developer, you'll do a lot of work with lists â€” list of DOM elements, HTML collections, arrays, etc.  For example, in the second project, List Pagination and Filtering, you'll paginate a long list of students to make it more manageable and user friendly.  It sounds easy enough in theory, but when you start trying to do it, and do it in a dynamic way that will work for a list of any length, this task can quickly become difficult.  So let's get some lightweight practice working with a short list where we'll just do something simple, like changing the color of a section of a list.

### Instructions

Starter files have been supplied for you.  Load the index.html file in Chrome and open the dev tools console.  Then follow along with the comments in the js/script.js file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the buttons on the page should highlight your desired section selection.

Best of luck and happy coding!
