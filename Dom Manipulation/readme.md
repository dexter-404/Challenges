# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Code Adventure - Weekend Coding Homework

## Fun DOM Manipulation - Great practice for project 2: List Pagination and Filtering

### Intro

As a web developer, you'll do a lot of DOM manipulation â€” creating and deleting DOM elements, adding and removing attributes, setting and changing text, etc.  While DOM manipulation can seem pretty straight forward, when you start trying to do it, it's easy to get stuck and confused.  So let's get some good practice with DOM manipulation by checking in on Mike The Frog and see what he is up to these days.  Let's use JS to add Mike and his cool tugboat to the DOM in this fun code challenge.

### Instructions

Starter files have been supplied for you.  Load the index.html file in Chrome.  Then follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  Tests have been written to provide extra feedback, and check if the correct elements have been created with the correct attributes.  Click the "Test" button to run those tests.  The tests won't check everything, so use the console as needed to log values and check for bugs and errors.  When you have completed this challenge correctly, you should see a tug boat towing Mike the Frog in an innertube, up the river.

Best of luck and happy coding!
