*Weekend Coding Homework.*

You don't have to be a mathematical genius to code, however, some mathematical knowledge can go a long way for when it comes to problem solving.

*With that said, my challenge:*
There is an array of an alternating positive and negative one.
Define a function called getValueAt with one parameter, n.
This parameter represents the index of the array, a.
Have this function return the value at index *n*

So, for example, getValueAt(1) should return -1 since that is the value at index 1.

```let a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1];

// define getValueAt```

*hint*: think of the relationship between the index and sign of the number at that index
