*Weekend Coding Homework.*

*Excellent practice for new coders*

Here are two options for simple little code challenges to get you some great practice and experience with the new powers you are developing.

*Option A: Create a basic calculator*
Write a function that takes in three parameters, two numbers and a string.  
Then in the function body, create a conditional that will perform an operation on the two numbers based on what the string is.  
If the string is "add", then add the two numbers.  
If the string is "subtract", "multiply", or "divide", then do that to the two numbers.

*Option B: Create a dice roller* 
Write a function that will produce a random number from a die.  
And have fun with it.  See how far you can take it.  
Can you make it work for multiple dice, like two for craps or five for Yahtzee?  
Can you create larger die like those used in D&D?
