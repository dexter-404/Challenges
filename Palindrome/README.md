*Excellent practice for new coders*

Here's a fun common little code challenge to get you some great practice and experience with the new powers you are developing.

*The Palindrome Challenge* 
Write a function that takes in a string as a parameter.  
Inside the function body, create a reversed version of the string.  
You can use the handy built-in .reverse() method, here, but for better practice, see if you can accomplish this with a loop instead.  
Hint: you can easily use the .split() and .join() methods to turn arrays into strings and vice versa.  
And you can use a decrementing iterator to start at the last letter and work your way back to the first for the reversal.  
Finally, compare the original string and the reversed string, and return true if they are equal, and false if they are not.  
You can use these strings to test your function: 'kayak', 'racecar', 'treehouserocks'.
