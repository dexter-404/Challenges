*What happens when you reach the end of the List?*

> Something you'll encounter from time to time as a coder and developer is working with lists that need to be looped over or clicked through repeatedly.  
Say you had a set of images to show one at a time on a web page, and your user could click through the images with some arrow buttons. 
What would happen when they reached the end of the list?  If you don't account for it, there will likely be an error.  
If the "next" button tried to grab the next image, while already on the last image in the list, the project will break.  
So let's do some lightweight practice around this.

I've spun up some starter files for you to work on this locally in your own text editor.  
I'll upload a zipped file below this post.  
All you have to do to work on this code challenge is to download the files, unzip them, open the directory in your editor, read through the README.md file, 
and then follow along with the comments in the js/script.js file.
